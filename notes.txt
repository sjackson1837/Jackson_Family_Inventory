Start to Finish - Creating this page:
	1. Create a new folder to store all of your files.  I created Inventory Tracker (changed this a few times) in my Documents folder
	2. Open VS Code and go to the folder you just created (I used the powershell terminal).
	3. Create virtual environment using the following commands.  
        - python -m venv virt
        - cd .\virt\
        - .\Scripts\activate
        - cd ..\\
			
	4. Install Flask - pip install flask
		a. You can check to make sure everything installed by typing - flask --version
	5. Create a new python file in the Inventory Tracker folder.  
    I called my file InvTracker.py (this is also changed based on the file strucure you see)
		a. Type this in the InvTracker.py file
		
		from flask import Flask
		app = Flask(__name__)
		@app.route('/')
		def hello_world():
		    return 'Hello, World!'
	
	6. GO TO YOUR CMD PROMPT TERMINAL:  
		a. Type:  cd .\virt\
		b. .\Scripts\activate
		c. cd ..\\
		d. set FLASK_APP=InvTracker
		e. flask run
		f. This will open the development server so you can view the InvTracker file you just created.
	
	6b. GO TO YOUR CMD PROMPT TERMINAL:
		a. Type:  cd .\virt\
		b. .\Scripts\activate
		c. cd ..\\
		d. python run.py
	
    7. Type: set FLASK_DEBUG = 1 (this will allow you to make changes to your code and just refresh the browser, instead of having to stop/start the server again.
	8. Create a templates folder in the 'Inventory Tracker' directory.  This folder will hold all of the html files

DATABASES AND MODELING - This section shows how to  create database files
	1. Type in cmd prompt:  pip install flask-sqlalchemy
	2. Now, import this into the InvTracker.py file:  from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
	3. Put this in the InvTraker.py file:  db = SQLAlchemy(app)
	4. Put this in the InvTraker.py file:  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///invtracker.db'
	5. Go to cmd prompt.  Type in flask shell
	6. This will give you three arrows >>>
	7. >>>from InvTracker import db
        >>>db.create_all()
        ***To delete all tables, type db.drop_all() before the db.create_all()
